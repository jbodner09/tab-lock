# Tab Lock

Problem: When I pin a dashboard or backlog, I want to stay on that site. I wish when I clicked on links they would open in a new tab. I don’t want the links I click to take over that tab that I pinned. Solution: This extension will let you lock and unlock tabs with a single click. Locked tabs can’t navigate – links, script, or address box – and instead open new tabs. Pinned tabs will be automatically locked, and normal tabs can be locked or unlocked through the extension's button.
